(* 
    This file covers definitions and proofs 
    regarding natural, integer, rational,
    and real numbers. 
    
    These definitions follow from Terence 
    Tao's 'Analysis'. The acronym 'TA'
    references Tao's 'Analysis' text, usually
    in reference to axioms, lemmas, theorems,
    definitions, etc.

    Coq's standard library provides an
    implementation of natural numbers with
    builtin decimal parsing. I'd like to use
    that, so much of this file is just
    proving that the axioms are true given
    the definitions of various sets of
    numbers that Coq has already put in place.
